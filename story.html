THE STORY OF THIS HACK !!!<br>

All began the first day that Nintendo announced this <q>Mario Kart 9</q> (They posted a trailer)<br>
So I started the first track (Room 1) ...<br>
After some weeks : The 9 October, I finished all tracks (Room 1 , Pc Room , World 1-1 and Ghosted Room (It's my favourite one! ^^ )).
But sadly , I travelled and my connectivity was almost dead during one week, That's why I didn't released all tracks BEFORE NINTENDO !!! =0 ...<br>
I have felt very sad ,I lose, Nintendo has won ! = ( <br>
After one complete night of thinking about this, I finally decided to make my hack more complete (all sounds, all graphs, etc..)<br>
The 14 November, Almost all stuff was finished, CaptainLuigi & TutoBrico did some beta testing, and they reported some important bugs , also they gave me some good ideas. <br>
And we started to use NitroWaves (ASM Hack by TheGameratorT)<br>
Also, I decided to make one full custom menu, all tracks' maps, custom item-boxes and a lot of other thing !<br>
In December, I did one little pause, for continuing my other projects, and I wanted to make one little gifts for Christmas.<br>
I made one special Christmas themed track : watch it !!!<br>
So, in 2021 , I made the two last tracks :<br>
-Award ceremony track<br>
-One placeholder<br>
All stuff was completed!!<br>
I made the official hack's trailer : <a href="https://youtu.be/bW9eRNPF5W0">https://youtu.be/bW9eRNPF5W0</a>   <br> 
And one tutorial : <a href="https://youtu.be/uYjOlfsLsns">https://youtu.be/uYjOlfsLsns</a><br>
Uh! So , it's all XD<br>
<br>
This is only one demo, One full version will be released soon (probably in next months?! XD)<br>
I'm also making some other projects as amazing as Mario Kart Real Ds !!Like Mario Kart Wii Ds, Mario Kart Retro Edition and ... Mk8 on Ds !! •-•.<br>
